# MarketStoreConsoleApp

The console application can be started by going src/MarketStoreSystem.java and running the main. It is developed using IntelliJ Idea IDE and Java jdk 10.0.2.

In the entities folder we have a DiscountCard class where we initialize all types of cards. We also have classes for all types of cards (BronzeCard, SilverCard and GoldCard) that contain the properties of each card and a class InvalidCard that is empty and is used for incorrectly entered cards.

We have two methods in the PayDesk class, the first returns the initialized type of each card and the second method is for printing the final values.

In the main class (MarketStoreSystem), we have an infinite while loop, which is interrupted if all the (do... while) loops inside it are executed correctly. The infinite while loop is divided into three parts, each repeated until the correct value is entered.
